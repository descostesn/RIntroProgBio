# Data Types

In the previous section, we have declared variables of type numeric (the variables contained numbers). You can assign other types of values to your variables, more or less complex. For this first lesson, we will cover the most simple types: Character,
vectors, matrices, tables (dataframe), and lists. Do not worry, we will cover more sophisticated structures later on.
