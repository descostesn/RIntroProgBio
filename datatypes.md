# Data Types

In the previous section, we have declared variables of type numeric (the variables containing numbers). You can assign other types of values to your variables, more or less complex. We will cover the most simple types: Character,
vectors, matrices, tables (dataframe), and lists. Do not worry, we will cover more sophisticated structures later on.
