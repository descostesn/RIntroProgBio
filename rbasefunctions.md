# R Base Functions

 This section introduces the mostly used R functions. This list is very subjective and built according to my own opinion. If you have this list of functions in mind (including what they do), I think that you will be able to do a lot of things. The complete list of R Base functions can be found [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html).
