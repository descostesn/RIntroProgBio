# R Base Functions

 In this section, you will learn about some important functions in R. A real life example will be given summarizing everything that you have learned, including the two  previous sessions. Finally, a brief introduction to coding your own functions is given.

 This section introduces the mostly used R functions. This list is very subjective and built according to my own opinion. If you have this list of functions in mind (including what they do), I think that you will be able to do a lot of things. The complete list of R Base functions can be found [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html).
