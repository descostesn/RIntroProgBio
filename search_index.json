workshop aims at giving an introduction to programming (with R) to the biologists of EMBL (and others). This course gives the fundamentals of programming focusing on biological problems. The intuition behind the code is favored at the expense of formal definitions. \nYou will find in this material definition of concepts with exercises. This is a 'hands on' workshop, just ask if you need any help. Try the commands yourself, this is the best way to learn.\n\"I am just going to read the material, I will try the commands later\". I would not recommend this. I like to compare programming to playing an instrument. Reading every single book about music will not turn you into Miles Davis! So practice and play with the code as much \nas you can!\nThis course is largely based on the following materials:\n\nIntroduction to R from openclassrooms (in French)\nR documentation on CRAN\nIntroduction to R by Bernd Klaus\n\nI also highly recommend the books of Hadley Wickham. You can find his books on his website for free! \nNicolas Descostes\nnicolas.descostes@embl.it\nFollow @NDescostes\n"},"whatisprogramming.html":{"url":"whatisprogramming.html","title":"What is programming?","keywords":"","body":"What is programming?\nYou heard the word but have absolutely no idea of what programming is? Do not worry, we are going to start from the very beginning.\n  When you use your computer to create an excel spreadsheet containing the list of the cell lines that you use, you perform multiple actions that your computer recognizes and interprets. Behind excel, you have thousands of lines of code translating the different operations that you perform: Insert text in this cell, save my file, plot the values of the column A, etc. You can now think about the job of a programmer as a \"computer translator\". The programmer uses a \"language\" (programming language) to \"speak to the computer\": 'open this file', 'create columns', etc. BAM! Now you understand why there are programming languages.\n  As people in different countries speak different languages, a computer can 'understand' different programming languages to perform different actions. It can understand 'Java' to display graphical interfaces, 'C' to perform some heavy calculations, or 'R' to analyze and plot biological data (you probably heard about Python as well). \n  In this course, you are going to learn how to \"speak\" to a computer :p. You will realize how fast you can be compared to what you do currently in excel and that you can perform much more!\n  In the next section, we are going to see what R is and why it is a good choice for your research in Biology.\n"},"whatisR.html":{"url":"whatisR.html","title":"What is R?","keywords":"","body":"What is R and what can I do with it?\nThe programming language R is well known for statistics. R was developed in the 90's at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. It is based on the S programming language (S for Statistics, yes they were very creative). \n   More than a programming language for statistics, R enables to manipulate data and to perform very powerful graphical representations. It is widely used and benefits from a large community that provides updates and new 'programs'. \n  IMPORTANT: In R, we do not speak about 'program' but about 'package' or 'library' \n  Widely used in academia, biologists and bioinformaticians quickly developed a community of users who shared their packages. An example is Bioconductor that provides around 1,500 packages to the bioinformatics community.\n  Let's now take a simple example of a typical use of R. When performing a RT-PCR, you have a serie of values to represent with a barplot. Below is how to do it with R:\n> pcr_values  barplot(pcr_values)\n\nIt is simple as this! You can also obtain some very fancy plots:\n\n  In summary, R enables you to process, organize, analyze and represent your biological data in a powerful manner. But to start playing with your data, you need to learn the basics. In the next section, we are going to see how to use R at EMBL and begin to play with the command line.\n"},"rstudioandrasacalculator.html":{"url":"rstudioandrasacalculator.html","title":"R studio and R as a calculator","keywords":"","body":"RStudio and R as a calculator\n  If you are not at EMBL, skip this paragraph. Seneca is a super computer that we have at EMBL. On this computer, the GBCS installed a RStudio server. RStudio is a software that enables you to develop in the R programming language. We will use RStudio during this workshop. \n  You can either use RStudio on Seneca (for EMBL employees) or install it. For the first option, connect to 'seneca.embl.de'. Click on \"Go to RStudio\". If asked to enter your login and password please do so. When you are at this point, let me know, I will now show to you how RStudio works and how to setup your account.\n  For the second option, install R then go to RStudio download page to download and install RStudio on your computer. \n  Below is a quick description of the interface. You can also check the RStudio documentation. You can find also plenty of tutorial videos on Youtube.\n\nThe interface consists of 3 main components:\n\nThe editor: This is where the code is written. You can save your work with the file management system (see last point below). You can also display existing scripts such as those provided in this workshop. Save the \nscripts to your favorite location and use the file management system to open it. \nThe console: This is where the code can be tested.\nThe file management and plots: You can manage your files from this interface. Plots will also appear in this section.\n\nR is an interpreted language. To cut a long story short, that means that you can code in an interactive manner.\nExercise 1: Start interacting with the console by entering the commands below and pressing 'enter':\n\nEnter a number\nEnter a decimal number\nPerform addition\nPerform multiplication\nPerform division\nCompute the remainder of 10 divided by 3 (use the %% symbol)\nCompute the cube of 5 (use the ^ symbol)\nTry ((10 + 15) / 5) - 3*2\nEnter '## 2+3'\n\n*NB: The lines starting with '##' are comments. They are not interpreted by the console. It is a good practice to use comments to annotate your code. Believe me, reading a piece of code that you did months or years ago without any comments is a real hassle. Using only one '#' will do the job too, but it is a good practice to use '##'.\nSome useful RStudio keyboard shortcuts:\n\nRetrieve previously entered commands:  'Up arrow'\nTest a command from the editor: 'Ctrl Enter'\nMove cursor to console: 'Ctrl 2'\nMove cursor to editor: 'Ctrl 1'  \n\nA complete list of shortcuts can be found here.\nYou have just performed your first programming session, congrats! R is a kind of super calculator as you saw, but it can do much more than this. \nIn the commands above, we did not stock any result which limits greatly what we can do. R uses different types of variable to store the results and perform subsequent operations on them. First thing first, let see what a variable is and what type of data structure R offers.    \n"},"variables.html":{"url":"variables.html","title":"Variables","keywords":"","body":"Variables\nOn a practical point of view, variables are just letters or words that you use in your program to stock values. More formally, the memory of a computer is organized as a grid made of cases. A 'simple' variable, for instance storing a numeric value, will write this value in one case of the memory grid. More complex variables, storing for instance your cell line table, will occupy several cases. In summary, a variable is just a structure of the R language that enables to store (and re-use) values in your computer memory. The word 'variable' is also used in other programming languages (Python, Java, C, etc) and is therefore not specific to R.\nWhy would I want to store values in my computer? Well, as we saw, you would want to compute for instance an addition, and use the result in a division!\nIn order to store values along your program, you need to 'assign' your value to a variable. The term used in Programming is to 'declare' a variable. Here is how you do it:\n> ## Declare a variale 'a' containing the value 42\n> a  ## Display the value of 'a'\n> a\nExercise 2:\n\nChange the value of 'a' to 8\nDisplay the value of 'a'\nPerform an addition and use the result in a division\nDisplay the result\n\nBAM! You got to the next level! Declaring and using variables in your program.\nNB: To declare a variable you can also use the symbol '=' but do not do it. This is very very ugly! Yes, there are weird programmers deciding about coding style practice :o. The real reason is to distinguish between variable declaration and parameters. You will understand this later.\nThere are few rules to respect in naming variables:\n\nIt should start by a letter\nThe variables are case sensitive (A is not the same than a)\nThe variables should not take names already used by R (Ex: You should not declare a variable 'bind')\n\n"},"datatypes.html":{"url":"datatypes.html","title":"Data Types","keywords":"","body":"Data Types\nIn the previous section, we have declared variables of type numeric (the variables containing numbers).

You can mix types and number of dimensions. You can also mix data structures. You can create for instance a list with a character vector, a matrix and a dataframe! But be careful, they are a little bit particular in the\nsense that accessing and modifying elements asks a different methodology. \nIn the example below, let's create a list that contains different information about a particular gene, \"CHD8\".

They also contain several values but have some interesting additional properties. Firstly, factors are mainly used to store qualitative values, i.e. values that have a descriptive information and not a quantitative one.\nFor instance, going back to our example of gene expression in different conditions, the expression values are quantitative and the conditions are qualitative.\n  More precisely, factors can contain different types of data: It can contain numerics or characters (or boolean, see next section). More importantly, it has levels which are values that each element of the factor can take. Not very clear, I know, keep reading. \n  Factors are close to vectors in the way that they contain a collection of elements, but each element has a limited number of values that it can take. Factors are widely used in Bioinformatics. It increases a lot the speed of computation for some given tasks. Factors are very useful for summary statistics, plots and regression.\n  I can feel your brain getting high in temperature. Let's cool it down, they are in fact super easy to use:\n> ## Create a vector describing treatment conditions for several of your samples\n> condition_values  ## Create a factor with these values\n> condition_factor  ## Pay a close attention to the result of the command below\n> condition_factor\n  You can see that displaying the \"condition_factor\" not only gives the elements that it contains, but also the different levels composing the factor. Levels is an ordered vector of the unique values of the factor.\nIf you did not understand the previous sentence, just have a look at the vector \"condition_values\"; order it alphabetically and remove the duplicated values. BAM! you obtained the levels of your factor.\n  In mathematics, you probably heard about the \"Universe\" of the data. A universe is all the possible values that your data can take. Therefore, the levels of a factor is the universe of its elements. Remember that they can only take a limited number of values. Going back to the example above, imagine that you perform a study of the transcription factor Myb. Because you are like mega smart, you build a system to have its conditional expression upon induction with Dox. On top of that, to publish in Nature or Science, and become super famous and super rich with a big villa in Santa Barbara, you perform a knock-down and a knock-out. The universe of your samples is \"WT\", \"KO\", \"KD\" and \"Dox\". Now you want to compare the WT with the KO but you want to use your universe to build your reports:\n> ## Create a vector describing treatment conditions for several of your samples\n> condition_values  ## Create a factor with these values\n> condition_factor  ## Pay a close attention to the result of the command below\n> condition_factor\n Still don't see the point? ok. Imagine now that you have 500 samples in an excel spreadsheet, one column is the name of the condition, one column is the sample and one is the number of expressed genes. And now, you are not the super scientist but the student who came two years after, and who was asked to reanalyze your data while you are putting your golfbag in your Mercedes to rush to the clubhouse to see the pictures of the new house of your best friend Arnold. That would be super nice if you could know the different conditions of the experiment in a few lines. For that, you typically can use factors. We are now going to see examples showing why factors are very useful for summary statistics and plots.\nALERT: In the following example, we will use some functions! Do not worry, you already used plenty of them: 5^3 (power), vector(), LETTERS, ':' (suite of numeric), names(), matrix(), rownames(), colnames(), data.frame() and list().\nDownload the file samplecondition.txt here\n> ## Read the table containing the two columns condition and sample\n> fi  ## Visualize the first lines of the table\n> head(fi)\n> ## Count the number of rows\n> nrow(fi)\n> ## Count the number of columns\n> ncol(fi)\n> ## Get the number of rows and columns at once\n> dim(fi)\n> ## Get the column names\n> colnames(fi)\n> ## Get the type of fi\n> is(fi)\n> ## Get the type of each column\n> is(fi$condition)\n> is(fi$sample)\n> is(fi$geneExpressed)\nThe two first columns of your table are factors! Now we are going to see why it is super useful:\n> summary(fi)\nBam! In one command you can see that there are 171 KD samples, 173 KO samples and 156 WT samples. You are now going to make your first plot. We want to represent the number of gene expressed in function of the conditions. \n > plot(fi$geneExpressed~fi$condition, xlab=\"condition\", ylab=\"Nb Expressed\",\n + main=\"Nb of Gene expressed per condition\")\nThis command is decomposed into the following actions:\n\nplot: Is the command to plot something (you did not expect that right?).\nfi$geneExpressed~fi$condition: This is a formula. What is on the left is the response and on the right the explanatory variable.

You are going to transcribe your thinking into your code! You will want very often to perform some operations requiring to evaluate if a statement is true or false. For instance, you might want to look for the expression of CD19 if you are treating B-cell samples or of CD4 if treating T-cell samples. The way to translate this logical thought is to code:\n\"If my sample is of type B-cell, retrieve expression of CD19, else if my sample is of type T-cell, retrieve expression of CD4\".\n\nLet's take one step further, from now on you have to think with TRUE and FALSE. The previous statement can be reformulated with:\n\"If B-cell is TRUE, check CD19, else check CD4\".\nSounds efficient isn't it?\nVocabulary: Boolean denotes the values TRUE/FALSE.

Again, before seeing how to code that, let'start with simple examples.\n> ## The AND operation is done with the symbol '&&'\n> TRUE && TRUE\n> ## The OR operation is done with the symbol '||'\n> TRUE || TRUE\n> ## The NOT operation is done with the symbol '!'\n> !TRUE\nKeep in mind the following rules when coding:\n\n\n\nStatement\nResult\n\n\n\n\nTRUE && FALSE\nFALSE\n\n\nTRUE || FALSE\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\nWhy?

Imagine that you want to print all values of a vector, if the vector is empty, seq_len will throw a correct error whereas with ':' it will not.\n> test_vec  for(i in 1:length(test_vec)) print(test_vec[i])\n> for(i in seq_len(test_vec)) print(test_vec[i])\nNote: The brackets can be omitted if a \"for\" loop contains only one instruction.\n"},"manipulatingcharacters.html":{"url":"manipulatingcharacters.html","title":"Manipulating characters","keywords":"","body":"Manipulating Characters\nMany functions enable to manipulate characters.

The reason is that the way R stores floating values in memory can be tricky. Test the code below:\n\n> x = seq(0,1,by=0.2)\n> y = c(0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0)\n>\n> x\n> y\n>\n> x == y\n> all(x == y)\n> all.equal(x,y)\n>\n> x[4] == y[4]\n> all.equal(x[4],y[4])\nGoing back to our vectors:\n> ## Are Some Values TRUE\n> vec3 > vec1\n> any(vec3 > vec1)\n>\n> ## Are some values duplicated\n> duplicated(vec4)\n> anyDuplicated(vec4)\n> anyDuplicated(vec5)\n>\n> ## Remove duplicated values\n> unique(vec4)\n> unique(vec5)\n>\n>## Make the element of a vector unique\n> make.unique(vec5)\nR represents missing values by NA (Not Available). You will very often find NA values when reading public data or your own table. The reasons for having missing values can be multiple: Lack of experimental data, error in reading functions, etc. A lot of functions in R have a parameter to handle missing values, usually it is denoted by 'na.rm' (rm = remove). Two important functions for handling NA values are is.na and anyNA:\n> x  y  z  vec6  is.na(x)\n> is.na(y)\n> is.na(z)\n> is.na(vec6)\n> anyNA(vec6)\n\nExercise 15:\n\nRemove duplicated values from vec5 and display it in reverted order\nAdd vec6 to list_vec\nUsing a for loop, display the vector of list_vec having missing values\n\n\nVery often it is necessary to find the elements of a vector satisfying a particular condition. The function which is very useful to achieve such goal is which:\n> ## Find the elements of vec4 that are higher than 3\n> which(vec4 > 3)\n> ## Find the elements of vec4 that are higher than 3 and lower than 5\n> which(vec4 > 3 & vec4 \n> ## Find the index of the minimum and maximum of vec4\n> which.min(vec4)\n> which.max(vec4)\n"},"manipulatingintervals.html":{"url":"manipulatingintervals.html","title":"Manipulating intervals","keywords":"","body":"Manipulating Intervals\nIt is useful to be able to compare collections of information.

Instead, the function apply enables to do the same thing. It takes three main arguments: the matrix, the MARGIN and the function. MARGIN should take the value 1 if the matrix should be read by row, or the value 2 by column. The function used below is the same as in the example above: mean. Enter ?apply in your console to read the documentation of this function.\n> apply(mat, MARGIN = 2, mean)\nThat much more efficient isn't it? The same thing can be done on list with the function lapply (apply on list, l = list). Because a list does not have 2 dimensions, the option MARGIN is not used:\n> result Now let see what is the type of the result returned by lapply:\n> result\n> is(result)\n> length(result)\n\"result\" is a list of two elements each containing a mean value. As you would want to perform further operations on this means, you would like to transform them to a numeric vector. As you saw before you could use unlist or as.numeric:\n> unlist(result)\n> as.numeric(result)\nA third possibility is to use sapply which is doing the same thing than lapply but returns a vector:\n> result  result\n> is(result)\nFinally, the last example of this section shows you how to use lapply/sapply on more than one structure. For that, you can use mapply where 'm' strands for 'multiple'. You understand now why mapply is the multiple version of lapply and sapply. It runs apply on multiple lists or vectors:\n> ## Creation of two lists with two elements\n> mylist1  mylist2 \n> ## Display the mean value of each vector of the lists\n> mapply(function(x, y){\ncat(\"The mean value of \", x, \" is \", mean(x), \"\\n\")\ncat(\"The mean value of \", y, \" is \", mean(y), \"\\n\")\n}, mylist1, mylist2)\n\nExercise 18:\n\nCreate two numeric vectors of equal size\nUse mapply to perform a 2 by 2 sum of values\nCould you use a more clever solution?\n\n"},"manipulatingfiles.html":{"url":"manipulatingfiles.html","title":"Manipulating files","keywords":"","body":"Manipulating Files\nIn this section we will create a directory and several files that we will manipulate.

You can control the directory that you are working in with getwd() (get working directory) and setwd() (set working directory). As you will read and write data to different folders, it is important to know where you are in your folder tree. This becomes even more useful when your scripts use relative paths instead of absolute paths.\nDuring your programming session, you will create a certain number of variables. To list all variables created during your session, you can use the command ls(). Some variables can store results of functions which can run for hours or even days! These results are precious and you will very often do not want to restart the whole process from scratch. Fortunately, R provides the functions save and load to store and use variables.\nA very important feature of R is that it loads your data to the live memory of your computer. Be careful not to load data that are too big, your computer will freeze and you will get stuck! To avoid over using the capacity of your computer, you will want to delete some variables containing data that are too big (when you do not need them anymore). To do so, use rm and the garbage collector gc(). The first takes variable names as parameter to delete them and the second frees the memory after deletion.\n> ## Get the working directory\n> getwd()\n> ## Set the working directory\n> dir.create(\"folder_to_enter_in\")\n> setwd(\"./folder_to_enter_in\")\n>\n> ## List all variables present in the current session\n> ls()\n>\n> ## Save a variable\n> test  save(test, file=\"test.Rdat\")\n> ## load a variable\n> load(\"test.Rdat\")\n>\n> ## Delete a variable\n> rm(test)\n> ## Free unused memory\n> gc()\nThe power of R stands in the fact that it benefits from a huge community of users. Users make packages available to the community. I mentioned in session 1 two repositories which are CRAN and Bioconductor. To install a package from CRAN or Bioconductor, you will do it from the R console (other ways to install packages are not covered here). For CRAN, you will use the function install.packages and for Bioconductor, you will use the package BiocManager. A package can be uninstalled with remove.packages. Finally, a package is loaded in R with the function library.\nPackages are dependent on the R and/or Bioconductor version. You will see that some code that was running fine on one R version will give you some errors on others. This is because the community is active and publishes updates regularly. R gives a major release every Spring, with several patches along the year, and Bioconductor is updated every 6 months. You can check your R version with R.Version() and the version of a particular package with packageVersion. \nIt is also useful to know where packages are installed,  use .libPaths().  \n> ## Install a package from CRAN\n> install.packages(\"ggplot2\", dependencies = TRUE)\n> install.packages(\"BiocManager\", dependencies = TRUE)\n>\n> ## Load the package BiocManager\n> library(\"BiocManager\")\n>\n> ## Install the Bioconductor package \"DESeq2\" and \"edgeR\"\n> install(\"DESeq2\")\n> install(\"edgeR\")\n>\n> ## Remove the package edgeR\n> remove.packages(\"edgeR\")\n>\n> ## Check your R version\n> R.Version()\n>\n> ## check edgeR package version\n> packageVersion(\"edgeR\")\n>\n> ## Check where the packages were installed\n> .libPaths()\nThere are different ways to get help in R. You can check the documentation of a particular function with ?myfunction or help. If you do not remember the exact name of a function, you can use apropos which will list every function containing the word that you gave as parameter. You can see an example code with the function example. You can also use a web browser to look for documentation with help.start(). The R community also provides tutorials called vignette. You can see a list of vignettes with the function vignette() and visualize a particular one with vignette(\"mypackagename\"). You can also see all available functions of a package by using the double columns \"mypackage::\" and pressing tab.\n> ## Load the package DESeq2\n> library(\"DESeq2\")\n>\n> ## Check all the functions available in edgeR (using the tab command)\n> DESeq2::\n>\n> ## Start the R documentation page\n> help.start()\n>\n> ## Get help on the function DESeqDataSetFromMatrix\n> ?DESeqDataSetFromMatrix\n> help(\"DESeqDataSetFromMatrix\")\n>\n> ## Visualize an example using DESeqDataSetFromMatrix\n> example(\"DESeqDataSetFromMatrix\")\n>\n> ## Find all functions using the string 'write'\n> apropos(\"write\")\n>\n> ## See all available vignette\n> vignette()\n> ## Check a particular vignette\n> vignette(\"DESeq2\")\nFinally, all the commands that you entered can be retrieved with the function history.
